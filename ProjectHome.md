The Inferno plug-in allows a full Inferno® operating system (or any convenient subset) to run inside a web browser.

Coupled with Inferno's portable applications, this means that any Inferno application will run within the browser without having to modify its code.  In other words, one can write browser-side parts of applications in the concurrent programming language Limbo®, which can be fun.  You can mount and access remote resources using Styx.  No XML need be used (now, that's really fun).

Currently the only browser supported is Internet Explorer® version 4 and above, but we hope to change that here.

All the source code to the various plug-ins are in this project.  See the Inferno project page (http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os) for the Inferno system itself.
