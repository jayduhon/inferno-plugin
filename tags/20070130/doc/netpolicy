Allow list
	domains / IPaddrs explicitly allowed

Disallow list
	domains / IPaddrs explicitly denied

if connecting to a match on the disallow list then ALWAYS fail
if connecting to a match of the allow list (after checking the disallow list) then connect silently
o/w prompt

Q's...
	How to prompt safely?
	How to set policy according to signature

have signature sections


"DEFAULT"
	patterns

"Internal"
	signatures
	patterns

"External"
	signatures
	patterns

How to know that code is internal?
- could set a special key in the HTML that has to match a section in the policy file.
	Dangerous, people will tend to call it TEST or some such guessable name.
	Could ALWAYS call it TEST or LOCAL and include an entry in the policy
	that causes the plugin to prompt before running such files.
Plug-in could analyse the Source path of files and mark them as local before
handing them over to emuinit.dis


If we are using signing thn must use packages
or sign modules and the resultant policy is the intersection of policy attributes
amongst the components
